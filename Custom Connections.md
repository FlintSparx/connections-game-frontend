### **1\. Project Overview**

This capstone project focuses on developing a full-stack web application that recreates the popular *NYT Connections* game — but with the twist of custom game boards. Users will be able to **play**, **build**, and **share** their own word association puzzles.

The app will support puzzle solvers, puzzle creators, and casual players by offering tools to create thematic boards, test out guesses, and challenge friends.

The project will include:

* A Connections-style game interface for solving puzzles

* A board builder for custom game creation

* A library of community-created games

Backend services to support:

* Board creation, storage, and retrieval

* Puzzle validation logic

* Optional user login for saving puzzles

This project will use the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** and **MongoDB**, giving learners hands-on experience in building game logic, dynamic UIs, and real-time feedback.

### **2\. Objectives**

**Build a Full-Stack MERN Application**

* Develop a functional MVP

* Implement a clean user flow for playing and building puzzles

**Enhance Developer Skills**

* Work with nested data structures (groupings, answers)

* Practice UI feedback and frontend logic

* Design RESTful routes and puzzle evaluation functions

**Deliver a Proof of Concept**

* Build an interactive, demo-ready prototype

* Include fully playable custom gameboards

### **3\. Core Features**

#### **3.1 Game Board Builder**

* Create 4 color-coded categories with 4 words each

* Add a title, difficulty, and optional hint

* Save custom boards to the database

#### **3.2 Game Player Interface**

* Display 16 shuffled words

* Allow users to group words and submit guesses

* Show success/failure feedback and reveal correct groupings

#### **3.3 User Authentication**

* Save boards under a user account

* Allow players to bookmark puzzles

#### **3.4 Game Library (Optional for MVP)**

* Browse puzzles by tags (e.g. pop culture, science, chaos mode)

* Play public puzzles created by other users

* Filter by most played, recent, or difficulty

#### **3.5 Integration**

* None required — completely self-contained logic

* (Optional) Share puzzle links via unique gameboard URLs

---

### **4\. Stretch Goals**

* Daily featured puzzle

* Private puzzle sharing via invite-only link

* Difficulty rating system

* “Chaos Mode” (5+ categories, decoys, or time limits)

---

### **5\. Success Criteria**

* Fully functional MVP with game logic

* Puzzle builder and play mode working cleanly

* Documented code and clean repo structure

* Stretch goals completed if time allows

---

### **6\. Learning Outcomes**

* Experience building a structured full-stack MERN app

* Strong frontend logic and interactive UI skills

* Design of game logic and error-handling

* Optional exposure to auth and shareable content

* Working with user-generated content and nested data
